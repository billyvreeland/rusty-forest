# rusty-forest

This is a first pass at teaching myself some Rust by implementing a random forest algorithm from scratch.  These are some initial small steps towards gaining a better understanding of whether any modern programming languages such as Rust are well-suited to become major players in data science and machine learning applications in the coming years.

I'm just getting this rolling, much more to follow shortly.
