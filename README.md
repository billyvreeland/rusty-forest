# rusty-forest

This is a first pass at teaching myself some Rust by implementing a random forest algorithm from scratch.  These are some initial small steps towards gaining a better understanding of whether any modern programming languages such as Rust are well-suited to become major players in data science and machine learning applications in the coming years.

I'm just getting this rolling, much more to follow shortly.

To run what is here so far:

```
git clone https://github.com/billyvreeland/rusty-forest.git
cd rusty-forest
cargo build
cargo run  # or ./target/debug/rusty-forest
```

It will run *much* faster if you build with the --release option and then execute ./target/release/rusty-forest
